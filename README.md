<p align="center"> This is a fun little React app that helps visualize what happens in a substring search using the KMT algorithm (Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm).  Built to test out tailwind and Redux (which is not needed for an app of this scale).

## 🎈 What did I learn? <a name="learnings"></a>
- Was fun to iterate through a loop by clicking a button step by step
- Tailwind - easy to use but I think there must be a better way to organize all the classNames
- Redux.  Still a lot to learn here but I wanted to give it a try

## 🎈 Todos <a name="todos"></a>
I could also visualize the KMT loop
